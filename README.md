# Breast-Cancer-Prediction-Using-Machine-Learning

•	Downloaded the data from Kaggle. 
•	Cleaned the data by removing the null values and performed label encoding for it to be in a machine-readable form.
•	Split the data into Independent and Dependent dataset (75% training and 25% testing dataset).
•	Performed feature scaling for normalization, using StandardScaler from the Scikit learn library.
•	Build a Logical Regression Model (Classifier) using the training dataset. Made use of the trained model to make predictions on the test data.
•	Calculated accuracy score of the model which was 97.90%.
